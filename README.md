The term "floriculture" simply refers to the farming or cultivation of flowers, according to Taylor & Francis Group. The floriculture industry encompasses any activity that involves cultivating flowers for trade reasons, with the sole intention of commercializing the flowers and their products. The goal of this project is to create an AI-powered mobile-based information system that tackles the issues that Kenyan flower producers experience in regulating soil nutrients and moisture for Roses, Carnations and Lilies. The system will use OOAD approach and Rapid Application Development methodology, leveraging development tools such as Android Studio, MySQL, TensorFlow, and the Kotlin programming language. The system will analyze soil nutrients, monitor soil moisture levels, and make individualized suggestions for rose, carnation, and lily flowers using data collected from dummy datasets, machine learning algorithms, and IoT technologies. The predicted outcome is a mobile application that improves decision-making, increases crop output, and optimizes resource utilization in the floriculture industry.
